# CipherShare: Decentralized Secure Cloud Storage

CipherShare is an ongoing project aimed at building a decentralized, secure cloud storage solution. The goal is to create a system that ensures data privacy, end-to-end encryption, and scalable storage by leveraging microservices architecture and modern cloud technologies.

## Project Overview

This project is in its early phases, focusing on building a robust and secure cloud storage system. The architecture will be modular, using microservices for scalability and reliability. The system will support secure, decentralized storage and encrypted access for users.

## Current Status
- **Phase 1**: Project synopsis, initial architecture planning, and database design.
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: The first version of the ERD is under development, focusing on key entities and their relationships.
- **Microservices Design**: Initial planning of independent services is in progress.

## Technologies to be Used
- **Microservices Architecture**: Java/Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL, Hibernate ORM
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **API Communication**: RESTful APIs, RabbitMQ/Kafka
- **Security**: Spring Security, OAuth 2.0, HTTPS
- **Deployment**: Jenkins, Helm
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Version Control**: Git (GitHub)

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Synopsis & ERD
- **Synopsis Document**: Includes the projectâ€™s problem statement, objectives, scope, technologies, and expected outcomes.
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: A draft ERD will define entities and relationships, with normalization practices being implemented.

### Next Steps
- Finalize microservices architecture and initial database design.
- Implement first set of microservices (e.g., user management, data storage).
- Begin Dockerizing services and setting up Kubernetes for orchestration.

## Future Enhancements
- Decentralized storage implementation
- Scalable microservices for file management
- Enhanced security with multi-factor authentication
- Real-time access and sharing of encrypted files
